# ZLCG
implementation for "Zero-Lag Correlation-Augmented Graphs for Scalable Spatiotemporal Forecasting"

## System Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
All experiments were conducted on a computational server equipped with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60 GHz and an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU with 48GB of memory. 
### Software Requirements
#### OS Requirements
Our experiments are all running in the system:
* Linux: Ubuntu 18
#### Python Version
Python 3.9 or higher is required
#### CUDA VERSION
our cuda version is 11.4
#### PyTorch Dependencies
````
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
````
#### Python Dependencies
After ensuring PyTorch is installed correctly, you can install the other dependencies:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
ST-Balance mainly depends on the Python scientific stack.

````
## Installation Guide
````
git clone https://github.com/ST-Balance/ST-Balance.git 
````
* It takes about two minutes.
## Demo

We provide one of the smallest datasets, PEMS08, as a demo, which is located in the `PEMS/datasets` folder. Enter the `PEMS` directory and run `demo.sh`. Other datasets need to be decompressed or downloaded before they can be used.

* Linux

  * ````shell
    sh demo.sh
    ````

* Windows

  * ```shell
    python train.py -c config/PEMS08.py
    ```

    

We have placed our own training logs in the checkpoints directory as a reference. The estimated training time is 104 minutes.

## Reproduction of Baseline Methods

To ensure a fair comparison of methods across different domains, we adopt various experimental frameworks for evaluation.

Traffic Flow:
* For the PEMS series datasets, we use [BasicTS](https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/BasicTS/tree/master/baselines) as the baseline framework for experiments (see the PEMS folder).
* For the LargeST series datasets, we adopt the original authors' publicly available code [LargeST](https://github.com/liuxu77/LargeST/tree/main/experiments) as the experimental baseline (see the LargeST folder).

Meteorology:
* We use the original authors' publicly available code [Corrformer](https://github.com/thuml/Corrformer) as the experimental baseline.

Epidemics:
* The raw data originates from [CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and is processed within the BasicTS framework (see the Covid19 folder). We also use the [STSGT](https://github.com/soumbane/STSGT), [SAB‑GNN](https://github.com/JiaweiXue/MultiwaveCovidPrediction) and [EpiLearn](https://github.com/Emory-Melody/EpiLearn/tree/main/epilearn/models/SpatialTemporal) as the experimental baseline.

## Dataset
Except for the epidemic dataset, the raw and processed data can be accessed through the links above. Additionally, all processed datasets are available at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11xEsQldS-MmVpq8VzIg9HEEhvCUQ7-QV).
